"""
Phase 1 — Live Pipeline.
Calls the running FastAPI /query endpoint for each golden sample.
Captures: actual_response (summarized via Groq to preserve key facts),
          actual_contexts (from sources), actual_tools_called (from thought_process).

Why summarize instead of truncate:
  Truncating to 300 chars cuts off facts mid-sentence, causing artificially low
  RAGAS scores (AnswerCorrectness, Faithfulness). Summarizing preserves all key
  claims in ~150-200 words, keeping token usage low while giving RAGAS accurate
  material to judge against the ground truth reference.
